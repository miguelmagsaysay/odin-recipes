    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Growing up in the Philippines, my dad would catch a lot of crab, and this
      was my favorite dish he'd make with it. It's a cross between a sauce and a
      stew, curry-like in texture and rich with flavors of the sea; think
      coconut milk, fish sauce, and shrimp paste, cut with the sharpness of
      ginger and scallions. Enjoy with freshly steamed white rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 whole Dungeness crabs</li>
      <li>½ cup garlic oil</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced garlic</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup thinly sliced ginger rounds, with skin on</li>
      <li>½ cup bias-sliced scallions, whites only</li>
      <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 (8.75 ounce) jar sauteed shrimp paste (such as Kamayan)</li>
      <li>5 Thai chiles, sliced into thin rings</li>
      <li>1 ½ quarts coconut milk</li>
      <li>½ quart water, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh spinach</li>
      <li>½ cup bias-sliced scallions, greens only</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Drop crabs in and cook
        until shells turn bright red, 8 to 10 minutes. Plunge crabs into ice
        water to stop the cooking process. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large wok over medium-high heat and add garlic oil. Stir in
        garlic and cook until lightly toasted and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
        Add onion and ginger and saute until onion is translucent, 4 to 5
        minutes. Add scallion whites. Season with a few pinches of salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add fish sauce and let infuse for 1 minute. Stir in shrimp paste and
        toast for about 3 minutes. Add Thai chiles; saute for 1 minute more.
        Pour in coconut milk and water. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to
        medium-low. Cook until sauce is thickened, about 10 minutes, adding more
        water if too dry.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, break open the crab. Add to the sauce along with any
        accumulated juices. Simmer until flavors meld, 8 to 10 minutes more.
        Season with salt and pepper. Toss in spinach and let wilt. Garnish with
        scallion greens.
      </li>
    </ol>
